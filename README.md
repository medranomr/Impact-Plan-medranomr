# Impacts on Society

<!Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course>

AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world problems and build relevant solutions. Additionally, students will complete lessons on digital citizenship as provided through the school district.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

<!Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/>

Students will understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology. 

Students will be knowledgeable about legal and ethical behavior related to their use of technology and information.

Students will predict the possible effects of their use and creation of technology.


### Learning Activities and Assessment

<!Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?>

Students will participate in various online discussions through the canvas platform. Each discussion topic will address different human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology. They will be provided with prompts based on videos or readings assigned throughout each unit. They will also be asked to read and respond to their classmates' contributions. Below are some sample assignments:
    
   - Students will read Chapter 1 of *Blown to Bits* by Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis and respond to the prompt: Argue if you agree that it is a "truth" and it will always be a "truth".

   - Students will watch the video *AI, Ain't I A Woman?* and respond with their thoughts on AI identifying gender. This will lead into discussion on machine learning and the importance of the data it is based on.

  - Students will read Chapter 5 of *Weapons of Math Destruction* and respond to the following prompt: "This chapter discusses many technologies associated with criminal justice and policing, and issues with these technologies. How do you think these issues should be addressed? What do you think is the best solution?"
  
Students will be assessed based on their participation and use of evidence to support their arguments.

Students will also participate in group discussions during class to share out their findings and conclusions based on their readings. Each person will complete their choice of readings and take notes. For the discussion, each person in the group will be given two minutes to share their initial thoughts from their chosen readings. After initial thoughts are shared students will discuss the prompts they were given and decide what they want to share out to the class. They will be assessed on their their presentation to the class. The following rubric will be used to grade each student during these group discussions:
| Objective  | Met | Not Met |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Notes for Resource #1  |   |   |
| Notes for Resource #2  |   |   |
| 2 Minute Summary  |   |   |
| Group Discussion  |   |   |
| Class Presentation |  |  |

### Outcomes

<!Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.>

This plan will facilitate diversity in computing by  
This plan will facilitate equity and inclusion by providing students with some examples of inequities in computing as well as current steps being taken to address them and provide greater inclusion. Further, students will be asked to consider inequities they may see and how they could be corrected. Finally, students will be asked to consider the impacts and accessibility of their own work.
This plan will help broaden participation in computing
This plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society by helping students to consider their own roles as creators and the effects of their work on the world around them. To consider how can their work be used with good or malicious intent. To reflect on how they can make their work inclusive and how their work can improve equity.
